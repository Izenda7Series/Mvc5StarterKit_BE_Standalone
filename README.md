 :warning: This kit has been recently migrated and we are still in the process of updating the documentation. If you require assistance, please contact Izenda Support.
 
## Overview
This Starterkit showcases how to embed the front-end of Izenda into a MVC5 application that uses a stand-alone API back-end.

 :warning: The MVC Kit is designed for demonstration purposes and should not be used as an “as-is” fully-integrated solution. You can use the kit for reference or a baseline but ensure that security and customization meet the standards of your company.
